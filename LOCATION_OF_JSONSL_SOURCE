Because either me or git are retarded, instead of
using git submodules, I will simply provide the
link to the repository containing the source code
for the jsonsl core code:

https://github.com/mnunberg/jsonsl

nb.

the 'jsonsl' file is a symlink. When you check out
the jsonsl source code, revive the symlink to point
to that location..
